# shape-context-ocr
The Shape Context is a shape descriptor that captures the relative positions of other points on the shape contours. This gives a globally discriminative characterization of the shape and not just a localized descriptor. These are then used to measure similarities between shapes and to recognize a character based on each edgeâ€™s polar-log distance to the other edges.
